Moreover, IT and the Internet have opened big opportunities for many to become IT Entrepreneurs. Many millennial and Z generation students have been attracted to entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship and Startup have become a jargon in almost all educational institutions. SGU Bachelor IT has been in the forefront in providing IT skills since the beginning. We constantly adapt our teaching to align with the demand of industry. As we have highlighted above, the need for AI and Data Scientists as well as IT Entrepreneurs is increasing, which is why our new curriculum offered in 2020 includes these two concentrations: AI and Data Science, and IT Technopreneurship.

    "description": " Artificial intelligence has actually become something that we usually encounter through today’s technological sophistication, for example, the computer vision application on the Electronic Traffic Law Enforcement (e-tilang) system in Jakarta that uses smart cameras. In addition, there are many other things such as Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and many more. In today’s world, data science also has a big role to predict information and generate useful insights for various fields, such as decision making in business, politics, health, etc. Committed as a university that always aligns with industry demands, Swiss German University is ready to facilitate these needs through the Information Technology - Artificial Intelligence & Data Science study program.",
